## 💬 About Me

 I'm a musician-turned-software engineer residing in New Orleans, Louisiana. I am experienced in building full stack JavaScript and Ruby applications, and I enjoy creating polished, responsive UI and clean, understandable code base. 
 
My current and continuing focus is in creating intuitive applications for music performance, audio recording, and sound therapy. I'm seeking new opportunities in the software and technology industry to expand my learning and development.
